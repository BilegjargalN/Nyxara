## Project Structure

The project is organized into a clear and logical structure:

- **`/api`**: Contains all backend PHP scripts for handling authentication, chat logic, and user settings.
- **`/config`**: Holds configuration files for the database connection, environment variables, and API settings.
- **`/database`**: Includes the SQL schema for setting up the database.
- **`/logs`**: Stores logs for database errors, API responses, and authentication attempts.
- **`/public`**: The web-accessible directory containing the main HTML files, CSS, JavaScript, and image assets.

## Setup and Installation

To run this project locally, you will need a web server with PHP and a MySQL database (like WAMP, XAMPP, or MAMP).

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2.  **Database Setup:**
    - Create a new database in your MySQL server (e.g., `nyxara2`).
    - Import the schema from the `database/schema.sql` file to create the necessary tables.

3.  **Environment Configuration:**
    - Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the `.env.example` file.
    - Update the `.env` file with your database credentials (DB_HOST, DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASS).
    - Generate a secure, 32-character random string for the `ENCRYPTION_KEY`. This is crucial for securing user API keys.

4.  **Web Server Configuration:**
    - Point your local web server's root directory to the `/public` folder of the project.
    - Ensure the server has the necessary PHP extensions (e.g., `pdo_mysql`, `openssl`).

5.  **Launch the Application:**
    - Open your web browser and navigate to the local server address. You should see the login/registration page.
    - After creating an account, you can log in and start playing.
